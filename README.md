# mbrodt.github.io
A portfolio website I built for myself to practice front-end web development & design.
Showcases past projects with links to code and contains a contact form to contact me directly.
The site is built with HTML and Bootstrap as the CSS framework of choice, using some JavaScript to handle navigation.
